#* A rule invocation record for parsing.
#
#  Contains all of the information about the current rule not stored in the
#  RuleContext. It handles parse tree children list, Any ATN state
#  tracing, and the default values available for rule indications:
#  start, stop, rule index, current alt number, current
#  ATN state.
#
#  Subclasses made for each rule and grammar track the parameters,
#  return values, locals, and labels specific to that rule. These
#  are the objects that are returned from rules.
#
#  Note text is not an actual field of a rule return value; it is computed
#  from start and stop using the input stream's toString() method.  I
#  could add a ctor to this so that we can pass in and store the input
#  stream, but I'm not sure we want to do that.  It would seem to be undefined
#  to get the .text property anyway if the rule matches tokens from multiple
#  input streams.
#
#  I do not use getters for fields of objects that are used simply to
#  group values such as this aggregate.  The getters/setters are there to
#  satisfy the superclass interface.
