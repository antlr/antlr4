= Test rig for go

This test rig will build and run the grammar file test.g4 with the `input` file for local testing by maintainers.

You should copy the `dev` brnach version of the antlr4 complete jar in to the antlr directory and you can then run
```sh
go generate ./...
go build .
```

You can change the `test` and `test_test.go` files to call the grammar you are working on (test.g4) and the input file
you want to test (`input`, in the same directory as test.go).
