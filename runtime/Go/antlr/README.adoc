Please note that the source code that was previously located in this directory is now located in the official release repository at: github.com/antlr4-go/antlr please use the code in that repo if you have a reason not to use modules.

== If you are using modules

Your driver code etc. should now be importing from the new release only repo for the runtime:

```go
import (
 github.com/antlr4-go/antlr
)
```
