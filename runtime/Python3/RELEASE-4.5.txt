What's in this release?

 - fixed bug where non-ascii input streams would fail
 - added support for visitor pattern
 - added support for wildcards in grammar

 Breaking change:

 In version 4.4, the parser/lexer had a tokenNames member.
 This has been removed in favor of the following members:
  - lexicalNames, containing the parsed text
  - symbolicNames, corresponding to tokenNames
