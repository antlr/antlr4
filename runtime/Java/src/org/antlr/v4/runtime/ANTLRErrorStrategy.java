/** The interface for defining strategies to deal with syntax errors
 *  encountered during a parse by ANTLR-generated parsers and tree parsers.
 *  We distinguish between three different kinds of errors:
 *
 *  	o The parser could not figure out which path to take in the ATN
 *        (none of the available alternatives could possibly match)
 *      o The current input does not match what we were looking for.
 *      o A predicate evaluated to false.
 *
 *  The default implementation of this interface reports errors to any
 *  error listeners of the parser. It also handles single token insertion
 *  and deletion for mismatched elements.
 *
 *  We pass in the parser to each function so that the same strategy
 *  can be shared between multiple parsers running at the same time.
 *  This is just for flexibility, not that we need it for the default system.
 *
 *  TODO: To bail out upon first error, simply rethrow e?
 *
 *  TODO: what to do about lexers

	 *  to recover. The default implementation uses single token
	 *  insertion and deletion. If you want to change the way ANTLR

	 *
	 *  From the recognizer, we can get the input stream to get
	 *  the current input symbol and we can get the current context.
	 *  That context gives us the current state within the ATN.
	 *  From that state, we can look at its transition to figure out
	 *  what was expected.
	 *
	 *  Because we can recover from a single token deletions by
	 *  "inserting" tokens, we need to specify what that implicitly created

	 *
	 *  Previous versions of ANTLR did a poor job of their recovery within

	 *  classDef : 'class' ID '{' member* '}'
	 *
	 *  input with an extra token between members would force the parser to
	 *  consume until it found the next class definition rather than the
	 *  next member definition of the current class.
	 *
	 *  This functionality cost a little bit of effort because the parser
	 *  has to compare token set at the start of the loop and at each
	 *  iteration. If for some reason speed is suffering for you, you can
	 *  turn off this functionality by simply overriding this method as
	 *  a blank { }.
