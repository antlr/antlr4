	 * This method provides the ability to detect mismatches between the version
	 * of ANTLR 4 used to generate a parser, the version of the ANTLR runtime a
	 * parser was compiled against, and the version of the ANTLR runtime which
	 * is currently executing.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * The version check is designed to detect the following two specific
	 * scenarios.</p>
	 *
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>The ANTLR Tool version used for code generation does not match the
	 * currently executing runtime version.</li>
	 * <li>The ANTLR Runtime version referenced at the time a parser was
	 * compiled does not match the currently executing runtime version.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Starting with ANTLR 4.3, the code generator emits a call to this method
	 * using two constants in each generated lexer and parser: a hard-coded
	 * constant indicating the version of the tool used to generate the parser
	 * and a reference to the compile-time constant {@link #VERSION}. At
	 * runtime, this method is called during the initialization of the generated
	 * parser to detect mismatched versions, and notify the registered listeners
	 * prior to creating instances of the parser.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * This method does not perform any detection or filtering of semantic
	 * changes between tool and runtime versions. It simply checks for a simple
	 * version match and notifies the registered listeners any time a difference
	 * is detected.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Note that some breaking changes between releases could result in other
	 * types of runtime exceptions, such as a {@link LinkageError}, prior to
	 * calling this method. In these cases, the underlying version mismatch will
	 * not be reported to the listeners. This method is primarily intended to
	 * notify users of potential semantic changes between releases that do not
	 * result in binary compatibility problems which would be detected by the
	 * class loader. As with semantic changes, changes which break binary
	 * compatibility between releases are mentioned in the release notes
	 * accompanying the affected release.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Additional note for target developers:</strong> The version check
	 * implemented by this class is designed to address specific compatibility
	 * concerns that may arise during the execution of Java applications. Other
	 * targets should consider the implementation of this method in the context
	 * of that target's known execution environment, which may or may not
	 * resemble the design provided for the Java target.</p>
	 *
	 * @param toolVersion The version of the tool used to generate a parser.
	 * This value may be null when called from user code that was not generated
	 * by, and does not reference, the ANTLR 4 Tool itself.
	 * @param compileTimeVersion The version of the runtime the parser was
	 * compiled against. This should always be passed using a direct reference
	 * to {@link #VERSION}.
