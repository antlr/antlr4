/** A DFA state represents a set of possible ATN configurations.
 *  As Aho, Sethi, Ullman p. 117 says "The DFA uses its state
 *  to keep track of all possible states the ATN can be in after
 *  reading each input symbol.  That is to say, after reading
 *  input a1a2..an, the DFA is in a state that represents the
 *  subset T of the states of the ATN that are reachable from the
 *  ATN's start state along some path labeled a1a2..an."
 *  In conventional NFA->DFA conversion, therefore, the subset T
 *  would be a bitset representing the set of states the
 *  ATN could be in.  We need to track the alt predicted by each
 *  state as well, however.  More importantly, we need to maintain
 *  a stack of states, tracking the closure operations as they
 *  jump from rule to rule, emulating rule invocations (method calls).
 *  I have to add a stack to simulate the proper lookahead sequences for
 *  the underlying LL grammar from which the ATN was derived.
 *
 *  I use a set of ATNConfig objects not simple states.  An ATNConfig
 *  is both a state (ala normal conversion) and a RuleContext describing
 *  the chain of rules (if any) followed to arrive at that state.
 *
 *  A DFA state may have multiple references to a particular state,
 *  but with different ATN contexts (with same or different alts)
 *  meaning that state was reached via a different set of rule invocations.

	 *  This array tracks the list of predicates to test in either case;
	 *  there will only be one in the case of a disambiguating predicate.
	 *

	 *  all of the early alternatives just to get to the predicates.

	 *
	 *  predicates = [(p,3), (q,4), (null, 2)]
	 *
	 *  This means that there are 2 predicates for 3 ambiguous alternatives.
	 *  If the first 2 predicates fail, then we default to the last
