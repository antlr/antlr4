/** A rule context is a record of a single rule invocation. It knows
 *  which context invoked it, if any. If there is no parent context, then
 *  naturally the invoking state is not valid.  The parent link
 *  provides a chain upwards from the current rule invocation to the root
 *  of the invocation tree, forming a stack. We actually carry no
 *  information about the rule associated with this context (except
 *  when parsing). We keep only the state number of the invoking state from
 *  the ATN submachine that invoked this. Contrast this with the s
 *  pointer inside ParserRuleContext that tracks the current state
 *  being "executed" for the current rule.
 *
 *  The parent contexts are useful for computing lookahead sets and
 *  getting error information.
 *
 *  These objects are used during lexing, parsing, and prediction.
 *  For the special case of parsers and tree parsers, we use the subclass
 *  ParserRuleContext.
