  ///
  ///  Subclasses made for each rule and grammar track the parameters,
  ///  return values, locals, and labels specific to that rule. These

  ///  Note text is not an actual field of a rule return value; it is computed
  ///  from start and stop using the input stream's toString() method.  I
  ///  could add a ctor to this so that we can pass in and store the input
  ///  stream, but I'm not sure we want to do that.  It would seem to be undefined
  ///  to get the .text property anyway if the rule matches tokens from multiple
  ///  input streams.

  ///  group values such as this aggregate.  The getters/setters are there to
