# The embodiment of the adaptive LL(*), ALL(*), parsing strategy.
#
# <p>
# The basic complexity of the adaptive strategy makes it harder to understand.
# We begin with ATN simulation to build paths in a DFA. Subsequent prediction
# requests go through the DFA first. If they reach a state without an edge for
# the current symbol, the algorithm fails over to the ATN simulation to
# complete the DFA path for the current input (until it finds a conflict state
# or uniquely predicting state).</p>
#
# <p>
# All of that is done without using the outer context because we want to create
# a DFA that is not dependent upon the rule invocation stack when we do a
# prediction. One DFA works in all contexts. We avoid using context not
# necessarily because it's slower, although it can be, but because of the DFA
# caching problem. The closure routine only considers the rule invocation stack
# created during prediction beginning in the decision rule. For example, if
# prediction occurs without invoking another rule's ATN, there are no context
# stacks in the configurations. When lack of context leads to a conflict, we
# don't know if it's an ambiguity or a weakness in the strong LL(*) parsing
# strategy (versus full LL(*)).</p>
#
# <p>
# When SLL yields a configuration set with conflict, we rewind the input and
# retry the ATN simulation, this time using full outer context without adding
# to the DFA. Configuration context stacks will be the full invocation stacks
# from the start rule. If we get a conflict using full context, then we can
# definitively say we have a true ambiguity for that input sequence. If we
# don't get a conflict, it implies that the decision is sensitive to the outer
# context. (It is not context-sensitive in the sense of context-sensitive
# grammars.)</p>
#
# <p>
# The next time we reach this DFA state with an SLL conflict, through DFA
# simulation, we will again retry the ATN simulation using full context mode.
# This is slow because we can't save the results and have to "interpret" the
# ATN each time we get that input.</p>
#
# <p>
# <strong>CACHING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTIONS</strong></p>
#
# <p>
# We could cache results from full context to predicted alternative easily and
# that saves a lot of time but doesn't work in presence of predicates. The set
# of visible predicates from the ATN start state changes depending on the
# context, because closure can fall off the end of a rule. I tried to cache
# tuples (stack context, semantic context, predicted alt) but it was slower
# than interpreting and much more complicated. Also required a huge amount of
# memory. The goal is not to create the world's fastest parser anyway. I'd like
# to keep this algorithm simple. By launching multiple threads, we can improve
# the speed of parsing across a large number of files.</p>
#
# <p>
# There is no strict ordering between the amount of input used by SLL vs LL,
# which makes it really hard to build a cache for full context. Let's say that
# we have input A B C that leads to an SLL conflict with full context X. That
# implies that using X we might only use A B but we could also use A B C D to
# resolve conflict. Input A B C D could predict alternative 1 in one position
# in the input and A B C E could predict alternative 2 in another position in
# input. The conflicting SLL configurations could still be non-unique in the
# full context prediction, which would lead us to requiring more input than the
# original A B C.	To make a	prediction cache work, we have to track	the exact
# input	used during the previous prediction. That amounts to a cache that maps
# X to a specific DFA for that context.</p>
#
# <p>
# Something should be done for left-recursive expression predictions. They are
# likely LL(1) + pred eval. Easier to do the whole SLL unless error and retry
# with full LL thing Sam does.</p>
#
# <p>
# <strong>AVOIDING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTION</strong></p>
#
# <p>
# We avoid doing full context retry when the outer context is empty, we did not
# dip into the outer context by falling off the end of the decision state rule,
# or when we force SLL mode.</p>
#
# <p>
# As an example of the not dip into outer context case, consider as super
# constructor calls versus function calls. One grammar might look like
# this:</p>
#
# <pre>
# ctorBody
#   : '{' superCall? stat* '}'
#   ;
# </pre>
#
# <p>
# Or, you might see something like</p>
#
# <pre>
# stat
#   : superCall ';'
#   | expression ';'
#   | ...
#   ;
# </pre>
#
# <p>
# In both cases I believe that no closure operations will dip into the outer
# context. In the first case ctorBody in the worst case will stop at the '}'.
# In the 2nd case it should stop at the ';'. Both cases should stay within the
# entry rule and not dip into the outer context.</p>
#
# <p>
# <strong>PREDICATES</strong></p>
#
# <p>
# Predicates are always evaluated if present in either SLL or LL both. SLL and
# LL simulation deals with predicates differently. SLL collects predicates as
# it performs closure operations like ANTLR v3 did. It delays predicate
# evaluation until it reaches and accept state. This allows us to cache the SLL
# ATN simulation whereas, if we had evaluated predicates on-the-fly during
# closure, the DFA state configuration sets would be different and we couldn't
# build up a suitable DFA.</p>
#
# <p>
# When building a DFA accept state during ATN simulation, we evaluate any
# predicates and return the sole semantically valid alternative. If there is
# more than 1 alternative, we report an ambiguity. If there are 0 alternatives,
# we throw an exception. Alternatives without predicates act like they have
# true predicates. The simple way to think about it is to strip away all
# alternatives with false predicates and choose the minimum alternative that
# remains.</p>
#
# <p>
# When we start in the DFA and reach an accept state that's predicated, we test
# those and return the minimum semantically viable alternative. If no
# alternatives are viable, we throw an exception.</p>
#
# <p>
# During full LL ATN simulation, closure always evaluates predicates and
# on-the-fly. This is crucial to reducing the configuration set size during
# closure. It hits a landmine when parsing with the Java grammar, for example,
# without this on-the-fly evaluation.</p>
#
# <p>
# <strong>SHARING DFA</strong></p>
#
# <p>
# All instances of the same parser share the same decision DFAs through a
# static field. Each instance gets its own ATN simulator but they share the
# same {@link #decisionToDFA} field. They also share a
# {@link PredictionContextCache} object that makes sure that all
# {@link PredictionContext} objects are shared among the DFA states. This makes
# a big size difference.</p>
#
# <p>
# <strong>THREAD SAFETY</strong></p>
#
# <p>
# The {@link ParserATNSimulator} locks on the {@link #decisionToDFA} field when
# it adds a new DFA object to that array. {@link #addDFAEdge}
# locks on the DFA for the current decision when setting the
# {@link DFAState#edges} field. {@link #addDFAState} locks on
# the DFA for the current decision when looking up a DFA state to see if it
# already exists. We must make sure that all requests to add DFA states that
# are equivalent result in the same shared DFA object. This is because lots of
# threads will be trying to update the DFA at once. The
# {@link #addDFAState} method also locks inside the DFA lock
# but this time on the shared context cache when it rebuilds the
# configurations' {@link PredictionContext} objects using cached
# subgraphs/nodes. No other locking occurs, even during DFA simulation. This is
# safe as long as we can guarantee that all threads referencing
# {@code s.edge[t]} get the same physical target {@link DFAState}, or
# {@code null}. Once into the DFA, the DFA simulation does not reference the
# {@link DFA#states} map. It follows the {@link DFAState#edges} field to new
# targets. The DFA simulator will either find {@link DFAState#edges} to be
# {@code null}, to be non-{@code null} and {@code dfa.edges[t]} null, or
# {@code dfa.edges[t]} to be non-null. The
# {@link #addDFAEdge} method could be racing to set the field
# but in either case the DFA simulator works; if {@code null}, and requests ATN
# simulation. It could also race trying to get {@code dfa.edges[t]}, but either
# way it will work because it's not doing a test and set operation.</p>
#
# <p>
# <strong>Starting with SLL then failing to combined SLL/LL (Two-Stage
# Parsing)</strong></p>
#
# <p>
# Sam pointed out that if SLL does not give a syntax error, then there is no
# point in doing full LL, which is slower. We only have to try LL if we get a
# syntax error. For maximum speed, Sam starts the parser set to pure SLL
# mode with the {@link BailErrorStrategy}:</p>
#
# <pre>
# parser.{@link Parser#getInterpreter() getInterpreter()}.{@link #setPredictionMode setPredictionMode}{@code (}{@link PredictionMode#SLL}{@code )};
# parser.{@link Parser#setErrorHandler setErrorHandler}(new {@link BailErrorStrategy}());
# </pre>
#
# <p>
# If it does not get a syntax error, then we're done. If it does get a syntax
# error, we need to retry with the combined SLL/LL strategy.</p>
#
# <p>
# The reason this works is as follows. If there are no SLL conflicts, then the
# grammar is SLL (at least for that input set). If there is an SLL conflict,
# the full LL analysis must yield a set of viable alternatives which is a
# subset of the alternatives reported by SLL. If the LL set is a singleton,
# then the grammar is LL but not SLL. If the LL set is the same size as the SLL
# set, the decision is SLL. If the LL set has size &gt; 1, then that decision
# is truly ambiguous on the current input. If the LL set is smaller, then the
# SLL conflict resolution might choose an alternative that the full LL would
# rule out as a possibility based upon better context information. If that's
# the case, then the SLL parse will definitely get an error because the full LL
# analysis says it's not viable. If SLL conflict resolution chooses an
# alternative within the LL set, them both SLL and LL would choose the same
# alternative because they both choose the minimum of multiple conflicting
# alternatives.</p>
#
# <p>
# Let's say we have a set of SLL conflicting alternatives {@code {1, 2, 3}} and
# a smaller LL set called <em>s</em>. If <em>s</em> is {@code {2, 3}}, then SLL
# parsing will get an error because SLL will pursue alternative 1. If
# <em>s</em> is {@code {1, 2}} or {@code {1, 3}} then both SLL and LL will
# choose the same alternative because alternative one is the minimum of either
# set. If <em>s</em> is {@code {2}} or {@code {3}} then SLL will get a syntax
# error. If <em>s</em> is {@code {1}} then SLL will succeed.</p>
#
# <p>
# Of course, if the input is invalid, then we will get an error for sure in
# both SLL and LL parsing. Erroneous input will therefore require 2 passes over
# the input.</p>

    # capable of successfully parsing to the end of the decision rule is
    # blocked by a semantic predicate. By choosing this alternative within

    # {@link NoViableAltException}, the resulting
    # {@link FailedPredicateException} in the parser will identify the specific

    # Implements first-edge (loop entry) elimination as an optimization
    #  during closure operations.  See antlr/antlr4#1398.
    #
    # The optimization is to avoid adding the loop entry config when
    # the exit path can only lead back to the same
    # StarLoopEntryState after popping context at the rule end state
    # (traversing only epsilon edges, so we're still in closure, in
    # this same rule).
    #
    # We need to detect any state that can reach loop entry on
    # epsilon w/o exiting rule. We don't have to look at FOLLOW
    # links, just ensure that all stack tops for config refer to key
    # states in LR rule.
    #
    # To verify we are in the right situation we must first check
    # closure is at a StarLoopEntryState generated during LR removal.
    # Then we check that each stack top of context is a return state
    # from one of these cases:
    #
    #   1. 'not' expr, '(' type ')' expr. The return state points at loop entry state
    #   2. expr op expr. The return state is the block end of internal block of (...)*
    #   3. 'between' expr 'and' expr. The return state of 2nd expr reference.
    #      That state points at block end of internal block of (...)*.
    #   4. expr '?' expr ':' expr. The return state points at block end,
    #      which points at loop entry state.
    #
    # If any is true for each stack top, then closure does not add a
    # config to the current config set for edge[0], the loop entry branch.
    #
    #  Conditions fail if any context for the current config is:
    #
    #   a. empty (we'd fall out of expr to do a global FOLLOW which could
    #      even be to some weird spot in expr) or,
    #   b. lies outside of expr or,
    #   c. lies within expr but at a state not the BlockEndState
    #   generated during LR removal
    #
    # Do we need to evaluate predicates ever in closure for this case?
    #
    # No. Predicates, including precedence predicates, are only
    # evaluated when computing a DFA start state. I.e., only before
    # the lookahead (but not parser) consumes a token.
    #
    # There are no epsilon edges allowed in LR rule alt blocks or in
    # the "primary" part (ID here). If closure is in
    # StarLoopEntryState any lookahead operation will have consumed a
    # token as there are no epsilon-paths that lead to
    # StarLoopEntryState. We do not have to evaluate predicates
    # therefore if we are in the generated StarLoopEntryState of a LR
    # rule. Note that when making a prediction starting at that
    # decision point, decision d=2, compute-start-state performs
    # closure starting at edges[0], edges[1] emanating from
    # StarLoopEntryState. That means it is not performing closure on
    # StarLoopEntryState during compute-start-state.
    #
    # How do we know this always gives same prediction answer?
    #
    # Without predicates, loop entry and exit paths are ambiguous
    # upon remaining input +b (in, say, a+b). Either paths lead to
    # valid parses. Closure can lead to consuming + immediately or by
    # falling out of this call to expr back into expr and loop back
    # again to StarLoopEntryState to match +b. In this special case,
    # we choose the more efficient path, which is to take the bypass
    # path.
    #
    # The lookahead language has not changed because closure chooses
    # one path over the other. Both paths lead to consuming the same
    # remaining input during a lookahead operation. If the next token
    # is an operator, lookahead will enter the choice block with
    # operators. If it is not, lookahead will exit expr. Same as if
    # closure had chosen to enter the choice block immediately.
    #
    # Closure is examining one config (some loopentrystate, some alt,
    # context) which means it is considering exactly one alt. Closure
    # always copies the same alt to any derived configs.
    #
    # How do we know this optimization doesn't mess up precedence in
    # our parse trees?
    #
    # Looking through expr from left edge of stat only has to confirm
    # that an input, say, a+b+c; begins with any valid interpretation
    # of an expression. The precedence actually doesn't matter when
    # making a decision in stat seeing through expr. It is only when
    # parsing rule expr that we must use the precedence to get the
    # right interpretation and, hence, parse tree.

    # Sam pointed out a problem with the previous definition, v3, of
    # ambiguous states. If we have another state associated with conflicting
    # alternatives, we should keep going. For example, the following grammar
    #
    # s : (ID | ID ID?) ';' ;
    #
    # When the ATN simulation reaches the state before ';', it has a DFA
    # state that looks like: [12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]. Naturally
    # 12|1|[] and 12|2|[] conflict, but we cannot stop processing this node
    # because alternative to has another way to continue, via [6|2|[]].
    # The key is that we have a single state that has config's only associated
    # with a single alternative, 2, and crucially the state transitions
    # among the configurations are all non-epsilon transitions. That means
    # we don't consider any conflicts that include alternative 2. So, we
    # ignore the conflict between alts 1 and 2. We ignore a set of
    # conflicting alts when there is an intersection with an alternative
    # associated with a single alt state in the state&rarr;config-list map.
    #
    # It's also the case that we might have two conflicting configurations but
    # also a 3rd nonconflicting configuration for a different alternative:
    # [1|1|[], 1|2|[], 8|3|[]]. This can come about from grammar:
    #
    # a : A | A | A B ;
    #
    # After matching input A, we reach the stop state for rule A, state 1.
    # State 8 is the state right before B. Clearly alternatives 1 and 2
    # conflict and no amount of further lookahead will separate the two.
    # However, alternative 3 will be able to continue and so we do not
    # stop working on this state. In the previous example, we're concerned
    # with states associated with the conflicting alternatives. Here alt
    # 3 is not associated with the conflicting configs, but since we can continue
    # looking for input reasonably, I don't declare the state done. We
    # ignore a set of conflicting alts when we have an alternative
    # that we still need to pursue.
