     * The default implementation of {@link org.antlr.v4.runtime.ANTLRErrorStrategy#sync} makes sure
     * that the current lookahead symbol is consistent with what were expecting
     * at this point in the ATN. You can call this anytime but ANTLR only
     * generates code to check before subrules/loops and each iteration.
     *
     * <p>Implements Jim Idle's magic sync mechanism in closures and optional
     * subrules. E.g.,</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     * a : sync ( stuff sync )* ;
     * sync : {consume to what can follow sync} ;
     * </pre>
     *
     * At the start of a sub rule upon error, {@link #sync} performs single
     * token deletion, if possible. If it can't do that, it bails on the current
     * rule and uses the default error recovery, which consumes until the
     * resynchronization set of the current rule.
     *
     * <p>If the sub rule is optional ({@code (...)?}, {@code (...)*}, or block
     * with an empty alternative), then the expected set includes what follows
     * the subrule.</p>
     *
     * <p>During loop iteration, it consumes until it sees a token that can start a
     * sub rule or what follows loop. Yes, that is pretty aggressive. We opt to
     * stay in the loop as long as possible.</p>
     *
     * <p><strong>ORIGINS</strong></p>
     *
     * <p>Previous versions of ANTLR did a poor job of their recovery within loops.
     * A single mismatch token or missing token would force the parser to bail
     * out of the entire rules surrounding the loop. So, for rule</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     * classDef : 'class' ID '{' member* '}'
     * </pre>
     *
     * input with an extra token between members would force the parser to
     * consume until it found the next class definition rather than the next
     * member definition of the current class.
     *
     * <p>This functionality cost a little bit of effort because the parser has to
     * compare token set at the start of the loop and at each iteration. If for
     * some reason speed is suffering for you, you can turn off this
     * functionality by simply overriding this method as a blank { }.</p>

     *  tokens. For literals such as '{' and ',', the default
     *  action in the parser or tree parser works. It simply creates
     *  a CommonToken of the appropriate type. The text will be the token.

    /*  Compute the error recovery set for the current rule.  During
     *  rule invocation, the parser pushes the set of tokens that can
     *  follow that rule reference on the stack; this amounts to
     *  computing FIRST of what follows the rule reference in the
     *  enclosing rule. See LinearApproximator.FIRST().
     *  This local follow set only includes tokens
     *  from within the rule; i.e., the FIRST computation done by
     *  ANTLR stops at the end of a rule.
     *
     *  EXAMPLE
     *
     *  When you find a "no viable alt exception", the input is not
     *  consistent with any of the alternatives for rule r.  The best
     *  thing to do is to consume tokens until you see something that
     *  can legally follow a call to r *or* any rule that called r.
     *  You don't want the exact set of viable next tokens because the
     *  input might just be missing a token--you might consume the
     *  rest of the input looking for one of the missing tokens.
     *
     *  Consider grammar:
     *
     *  a : '[' b ']'
     *    | '(' b ')'
     *    ;
     *  b : c '^' INT ;
     *  c : ID
     *    | INT
     *    ;
     *
     *  At each rule invocation, the set of tokens that could follow
     *  that rule is pushed on a stack.  Here are the various
     *  context-sensitive follow sets:
     *
     *  FOLLOW(b1_in_a) = FIRST(']') = ']'
     *  FOLLOW(b2_in_a) = FIRST(')') = ')'
     *  FOLLOW(c_in_b) = FIRST('^') = '^'
     *
     *  Upon erroneous input "[]", the call chain is
     *
     *  a -> b -> c
     *
     *  and, hence, the follow context stack is:
     *
     *  depth     follow set       start of rule execution
     *    0         <EOF>                    a (from main())
     *    1          ']'                     b
     *    2          '^'                     c
     *
     *  Notice that ')' is not included, because b would have to have
     *  been called from a different context in rule a for ')' to be
     *  included.
     *
     *  For error recovery, we cannot consider FOLLOW(c)
     *  (context-sensitive or otherwise).  We need the combined set of
     *  all context-sensitive FOLLOW sets--the set of all tokens that
     *  could follow any reference in the call chain.  We need to
     *  resync to one of those tokens.  Note that FOLLOW(c)='^' and if
     *  we resync'd to that token, we'd consume until EOF.  We need to
     *  sync to context-sensitive FOLLOWs for a, b, and c: {']','^'}.
     *  In this case, for input "[]", LA(1) is ']' and in the set, so we would
     *  not consume anything. After printing an error, rule c would
     *  return normally.  Rule b would not find the required '^' though.
     *  At this point, it gets a mismatched token error and throws an
     *  exception (since LA(1) is not in the viable following token
     *  set).  The rule exception handler tries to recover, but finds
     *  the same recovery set and doesn't consume anything.  Rule b
     *  exits normally returning to rule a.  Now it finds the ']' (and
     *  with the successful match exits errorRecovery mode).
     *
     *  So, you can see that the parser walks up the call chain looking
     *  for the token that was a member of the recovery set.
     *
     *  Errors are not generated in errorRecovery mode.
     *
     *  ANTLR's error recovery mechanism is based upon original ideas:
     *
     *  "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" by Niklaus Wirth
     *
     *  and
     *
     *  "A note on error recovery in recursive descent parsers":
     *  http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=947902.947905
     *
     *  Later, Josef Grosch had some good ideas:
     *
     *  "Efficient and Comfortable Error Recovery in Recursive Descent
     *  Parsers":
     *  ftp://www.cocolab.com/products/cocktail/doca4.ps/ell.ps.zip
     *
     *  Like Grosch I implement context-sensitive FOLLOW sets that are combined
     *  at run-time upon error to avoid overhead during parsing.
