/**
* This class represents profiling event information for an ambiguity.
* Ambiguities are decisions where a particular input resulted in an SLL
* conflict, followed by LL prediction also reaching a conflict state
* (indicating a true ambiguity in the grammar).
*
* <p>
* This event may be reported during SLL prediction in cases where the
* conflicting SLL configuration set provides sufficient information to
* determine that the SLL conflict is truly an ambiguity. For example, if none
* of the ATN configurations in the conflicting SLL configuration set have
* traversed a global follow transition (i.e.
* {@link org.antlr.v4.runtime.atn.ATNConfig#reachesIntoOuterContext} is 0 for all configurations), then
* the result of SLL prediction for that input is known to be equivalent to the
* result of LL prediction for that input.</p>
*
* <p>
* In some cases, the minimum represented alternative in the conflicting LL
* configuration set is not equal to the minimum represented alternative in the
* conflicting SLL configuration set. Grammars and inputs which result in this
* scenario are unable to use {@link org.antlr.v4.runtime.atn.PredictionMode#SLL}, which in turn means
* they cannot use the two-stage parsing strategy to improve parsing performance
* for that input.</p>
