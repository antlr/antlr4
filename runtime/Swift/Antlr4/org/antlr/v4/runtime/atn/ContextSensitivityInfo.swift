/**
 * This class represents profiling event information for a context sensitivity.
 * Context sensitivities are decisions where a particular input resulted in an
 * SLL conflict, but LL prediction produced a single unique alternative.
 *
 * <p>
 * In some cases, the unique alternative identified by LL prediction is not
 * equal to the minimum represented alternative in the conflicting SLL
 * configuration set. Grammars and inputs which result in this scenario are
 * unable to use {@link org.antlr.v4.runtime.atn.PredictionMode#SLL}, which in turn means they cannot use
 * the two-stage parsing strategy to improve parsing performance for that
 * input.</p>
 *
 * @see org.antlr.v4.runtime.atn.ParserATNSimulator#reportContextSensitivity
