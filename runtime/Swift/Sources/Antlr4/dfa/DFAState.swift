/// A DFA state represents a set of possible ATN configurations.
/// As Aho, Sethi, Ullman p. 117 says "The DFA uses its state
/// to keep track of all possible states the ATN can be in after
/// reading each input symbol.  That is to say, after reading
/// input a1a2..an, the DFA is in a state that represents the
/// subset T of the states of the ATN that are reachable from the
/// ATN's start state along some path labeled a1a2..an."
/// In conventional NFA&rarr;DFA conversion, therefore, the subset T
/// would be a bitset representing the set of states the
/// ATN could be in.  We need to track the alt predicted by each
/// state as well, however.  More importantly, we need to maintain
/// a stack of states, tracking the closure operations as they
/// jump from rule to rule, emulating rule invocations (method calls).
/// I have to add a stack to simulate the proper lookahead sequences for
/// the underlying LL grammar from which the ATN was derived.
/// 
/// I use a set of ATNConfig objects not simple states.  An ATNConfig
/// is both a state (ala normal conversion) and a RuleContext describing
/// the chain of rules (if any) followed to arrive at that state.
/// 
/// A DFA state may have multiple references to a particular state,
/// but with different ATN contexts (with same or different alts)
/// meaning that state was reached via a different set of rule invocations.
