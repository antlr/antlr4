	/**
	 * The embodiment of the adaptive LL(*), ALL(*), parsing strategy.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * The basic complexity of the adaptive strategy makes it harder to understand.
	 * We begin with ATN simulation to build paths in a DFA. Subsequent prediction
	 * requests go through the DFA first. If they reach a state without an edge for
	 * the current symbol, the algorithm fails over to the ATN simulation to
	 * complete the DFA path for the current input (until it finds a conflict state
	 * or uniquely predicting state).</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * All of that is done without using the outer context because we want to create
	 * a DFA that is not dependent upon the rule invocation stack when we do a
	 * prediction. One DFA works in all contexts. We avoid using context not
	 * necessarily because it's slower, although it can be, but because of the DFA
	 * caching problem. The closure routine only considers the rule invocation stack
	 * created during prediction beginning in the decision rule. For example, if
	 * prediction occurs without invoking another rule's ATN, there are no context
	 * stacks in the configurations. When lack of context leads to a conflict, we
	 * don't know if it's an ambiguity or a weakness in the strong LL(*) parsing
	 * strategy (versus full LL(*)).</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * When SLL yields a configuration set with conflict, we rewind the input and
	 * retry the ATN simulation, this time using full outer context without adding
	 * to the DFA. Configuration context stacks will be the full invocation stacks
	 * from the start rule. If we get a conflict using full context, then we can
	 * definitively say we have a true ambiguity for that input sequence. If we
	 * don't get a conflict, it implies that the decision is sensitive to the outer
	 * context. (It is not context-sensitive in the sense of context-sensitive
	 * grammars.)</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * The next time we reach this DFA state with an SLL conflict, through DFA
	 * simulation, we will again retry the ATN simulation using full context mode.
	 * This is slow because we can't save the results and have to "interpret" the
	 * ATN each time we get that input.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>CACHING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTIONS</strong></p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * We could cache results from full context to predicted alternative easily and
	 * that saves a lot of time but doesn't work in presence of predicates. The set
	 * of visible predicates from the ATN start state changes depending on the
	 * context, because closure can fall off the end of a rule. I tried to cache
	 * tuples (stack context, semantic context, predicted alt) but it was slower
	 * than interpreting and much more complicated. Also required a huge amount of
	 * memory. The goal is not to create the world's fastest parser anyway. I'd like
	 * to keep this algorithm simple. By launching multiple threads, we can improve
	 * the speed of parsing across a large number of files.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * There is no strict ordering between the amount of input used by SLL vs LL,
	 * which makes it really hard to build a cache for full context. Let's say that
	 * we have input A B C that leads to an SLL conflict with full context X. That
	 * implies that using X we might only use A B but we could also use A B C D to
	 * resolve conflict. Input A B C D could predict alternative 1 in one position
	 * in the input and A B C E could predict alternative 2 in another position in
	 * input. The conflicting SLL configurations could still be non-unique in the
	 * full context prediction, which would lead us to requiring more input than the
	 * original A B C.	To make a	prediction cache work, we have to track	the exact
	 * input	used during the previous prediction. That amounts to a cache that maps
	 * X to a specific DFA for that context.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Something should be done for left-recursive expression predictions. They are
	 * likely LL(1) + pred eval. Easier to do the whole SLL unless error and retry
	 * with full LL thing Sam does.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>AVOIDING FULL CONTEXT PREDICTION</strong></p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * We avoid doing full context retry when the outer context is empty, we did not
	 * dip into the outer context by falling off the end of the decision state rule,
	 * or when we force SLL mode.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * As an example of the not dip into outer context case, consider as super
	 * constructor calls versus function calls. One grammar might look like
	 * this:</p>
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * ctorBody
	 *   : '{' superCall? stat* '}'
	 *   ;
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Or, you might see something like</p>
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * stat
	 *   : superCall ';'
	 *   | expression ';'
	 *   | ...
	 *   ;
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * In both cases I believe that no closure operations will dip into the outer
	 * context. In the first case ctorBody in the worst case will stop at the '}'.
	 * In the 2nd case it should stop at the ';'. Both cases should stay within the
	 * entry rule and not dip into the outer context.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>PREDICATES</strong></p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Predicates are always evaluated if present in either SLL or LL both. SLL and
	 * LL simulation deals with predicates differently. SLL collects predicates as
	 * it performs closure operations like ANTLR v3 did. It delays predicate
	 * evaluation until it reaches and accept state. This allows us to cache the SLL
	 * ATN simulation whereas, if we had evaluated predicates on-the-fly during
	 * closure, the DFA state configuration sets would be different and we couldn't
	 * build up a suitable DFA.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * When building a DFA accept state during ATN simulation, we evaluate any
	 * predicates and return the sole semantically valid alternative. If there is
	 * more than 1 alternative, we report an ambiguity. If there are 0 alternatives,
	 * we throw an exception. Alternatives without predicates act like they have
	 * true predicates. The simple way to think about it is to strip away all
	 * alternatives with false predicates and choose the minimum alternative that
	 * remains.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * When we start in the DFA and reach an accept state that's predicated, we test
	 * those and return the minimum semantically viable alternative. If no
	 * alternatives are viable, we throw an exception.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * During full LL ATN simulation, closure always evaluates predicates and
	 * on-the-fly. This is crucial to reducing the configuration set size during
	 * closure. It hits a landmine when parsing with the Java grammar, for example,
	 * without this on-the-fly evaluation.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>SHARING DFA</strong></p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * All instances of the same parser share the same decision DFAs through a
	 * static field. Each instance gets its own ATN simulator but they share the
	 * same {@link #decisionToDFA} field. They also share a
	 * {@link PredictionContextCache} object that makes sure that all
	 * {@link PredictionContext} objects are shared among the DFA states. This makes
	 * a big size difference.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>THREAD SAFETY</strong></p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * The {@link ParserATNSimulator} locks on the {@link #decisionToDFA} field when
	 * it adds a new DFA object to that array. {@link #addDFAEdge}
	 * locks on the DFA for the current decision when setting the
	 * {@link DFAState#edges} field. {@link #addDFAState} locks on
	 * the DFA for the current decision when looking up a DFA state to see if it
	 * already exists. We must make sure that all requests to add DFA states that
	 * are equivalent result in the same shared DFA object. This is because lots of
	 * threads will be trying to update the DFA at once. The
	 * {@link #addDFAState} method also locks inside the DFA lock
	 * but this time on the shared context cache when it rebuilds the
	 * configurations' {@link PredictionContext} objects using cached
	 * subgraphs/nodes. No other locking occurs, even during DFA simulation. This is
	 * safe as long as we can guarantee that all threads referencing
	 * {@code s.edge[t]} get the same physical target {@link DFAState}, or
	 * {@code null}. Once into the DFA, the DFA simulation does not reference the
	 * {@link DFA#states} map. It follows the {@link DFAState#edges} field to new
	 * targets. The DFA simulator will either find {@link DFAState#edges} to be
	 * {@code null}, to be non-{@code null} and {@code dfa.edges[t]} null, or
	 * {@code dfa.edges[t]} to be non-null. The
	 * {@link #addDFAEdge} method could be racing to set the field
	 * but in either case the DFA simulator works; if {@code null}, and requests ATN
	 * simulation. It could also race trying to get {@code dfa.edges[t]}, but either
	 * way it will work because it's not doing a test and set operation.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Starting with SLL then failing to combined SLL/LL (Two-Stage
	 * Parsing)</strong></p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Sam pointed out that if SLL does not give a syntax error, then there is no
	 * point in doing full LL, which is slower. We only have to try LL if we get a
	 * syntax error. For maximum speed, Sam starts the parser set to pure SLL
	 * mode with the {@link BailErrorStrategy}:</p>
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * parser.{@link Parser#getInterpreter() getInterpreter()}.{@link #setPredictionMode setPredictionMode}{@code (}{@link PredictionMode#SLL}{@code )};
	 * parser.{@link Parser#setErrorHandler setErrorHandler}(new {@link BailErrorStrategy}());
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * If it does not get a syntax error, then we're done. If it does get a syntax
	 * error, we need to retry with the combined SLL/LL strategy.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * The reason this works is as follows. If there are no SLL conflicts, then the
	 * grammar is SLL (at least for that input set). If there is an SLL conflict,
	 * the full LL analysis must yield a set of viable alternatives which is a
	 * subset of the alternatives reported by SLL. If the LL set is a singleton,
	 * then the grammar is LL but not SLL. If the LL set is the same size as the SLL
	 * set, the decision is SLL. If the LL set has size &gt; 1, then that decision
	 * is truly ambiguous on the current input. If the LL set is smaller, then the
	 * SLL conflict resolution might choose an alternative that the full LL would
	 * rule out as a possibility based upon better context information. If that's
	 * the case, then the SLL parse will definitely get an error because the full LL
	 * analysis says it's not viable. If SLL conflict resolution chooses an
	 * alternative within the LL set, them both SLL and LL would choose the same
	 * alternative because they both choose the minimum of multiple conflicting
	 * alternatives.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Let's say we have a set of SLL conflicting alternatives {@code {1, 2, 3}} and
	 * a smaller LL set called <em>s</em>. If <em>s</em> is {@code {2, 3}}, then SLL
	 * parsing will get an error because SLL will pursue alternative 1. If
	 * <em>s</em> is {@code {1, 2}} or {@code {1, 3}} then both SLL and LL will
	 * choose the same alternative because alternative one is the minimum of either
	 * set. If <em>s</em> is {@code {2}} or {@code {3}} then SLL will get a syntax
	 * error. If <em>s</em> is {@code {1}} then SLL will succeed.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Of course, if the input is invalid, then we will get an error for sure in
	 * both SLL and LL parsing. Erroneous input will therefore require 2 passes over
	 * the input.</p>

			context-sensitive in that they can only be properly evaluated
			in the context of the proper prec argument. Without pruning,
			these predicates are normal predicates evaluated when we reach
			conflict state (or unique prediction). As we cannot evaluate
			these predicates out of context, the resulting conflict leads
			to full LL evaluation and nonlinear prediction which shows up
			very clearly with fairly large expressions.

			Example grammar:

			e : e '*' e
			  | e '+' e
			  | INT
			  ;

			We convert that to the following:

			e[int prec]
				:   INT
					( {3>=prec}? '*' e[4]
					| {2>=prec}? '+' e[3]
					)*
				;

			The (..)* loop has a decision for the inner block as well as
			an enter or exit decision, which is what concerns us here. At
			the 1st + of input 1+2+3, the loop entry sees both predicates
			and the loop exit also sees both predicates by falling off the
			edge of e.  This is because we have no stack information with
			SLL and find the follow of e, which will hit the return states
			inside the loop after e[4] and e[3], which brings it back to
			the enter or exit decision. In this case, we know that we
			cannot evaluate those predicates because we have fallen off
			the edge of the stack and will in general not know which prec
			parameter is the right one to use in the predicate.

			Because we have special information, that these are precedence
			predicates, we can resolve them without failing over to full
			LL despite their context sensitive nature. We make an
			assumption that prec[-1] <= prec[0], meaning that the current
			precedence level is greater than or equal to the precedence
			level of recursive invocations above us in the stack. For
			example, if predicate {3>=prec}? is true of the current prec,
			then one option is to enter the loop to match it now. The
			other option is to exit the loop and the left recursive rule
			to match the current operator in rule invocation further up
			the stack. But, we know that all of those prec are lower or
			the same value and so we can decide to enter the loop instead
			of matching it later. That means we can strip out the other
			configuration for the exit branch.

			So imagine we have (14,1,$,{2>=prec}?) and then
			(14,2,$-dipsIntoOuterContext,{2>=prec}?). The optimization
			allows us to collapse these two configurations. We know that
			if {2>=prec}? is true for the current prec parameter, it will
			also be true for any prec from an invoking e call, indicated
			by dipsIntoOuterContext. As the predicates are both true, we
			have the option to evaluate them early in the decision start
			state. We do this by stripping both predicates and choosing to
			enter the loop as it is consistent with the notion of operator
			precedence. It's also how the full LL conflict resolution
			would work.

			The solution requires a different DFA start state for each
			precedence level.

			The basic filter mechanism is to remove configurations of the
			form (p, 2, pi) if (p, 1, pi) exists for the same p and pi. In
			other words, for the same ATN state and predicate context,
			remove any configuration associated with an exit branch if
			there is a configuration associated with the enter branch.

			It's also the case that the filter evaluates precedence
			predicates and resolves conflicts according to precedence
			levels. For example, for input 1+2+3 at the first +, we see
			prediction filtering

			[(11,1,[$],{3>=prec}?), (14,1,[$],{2>=prec}?), (5,2,[$],up=1),
			 (11,2,[$],up=1), (14,2,[$],up=1)],hasSemanticContext=true,dipsIntoOuterContext

			to

			[(11,1,[$]), (14,1,[$]), (5,2,[$],up=1)],dipsIntoOuterContext

			This filters because {3>=prec}? evals to true and collapses
			(11,1,[$],{3>=prec}?) and (11,2,[$],up=1) since early conflict
			resolution based upon rules of operator precedence fits with
			our usual match first alt upon conflict.

			We noticed a problem where a recursive call resets precedence
			to 0. Sam's fix: each config has flag indicating if it has
			returned from an expr[0] call. then just don't filter any
			config with that flag set. flag is carried along in
			closure(). so to avoid adding field, set bit just under sign
			bit of dipsIntoOuterContext (SUPPRESS_PRECEDENCE_FILTER).
			With the change you filter "unless (p, 2, pi) was reached
			after leaving the rule stop state of the LR rule containing
			state p, corresponding to a rule invocation with precedence
			level 0"

		 * <li>The "primary" portion of a left recursive rule cannot contain an

		/** Implements first-edge (loop entry) elimination as an optimization
		 *  during closure operations.  See antlr/antlr4#1398.
		 *
		 * The optimization is to avoid adding the loop entry config when
		 * the exit path can only lead back to the same
		 * StarLoopEntryState after popping context at the rule end state
		 * (traversing only epsilon edges, so we're still in closure, in
		 * this same rule).
		 *
		 * We need to detect any state that can reach loop entry on
		 * epsilon w/o exiting rule. We don't have to look at FOLLOW
		 * links, just ensure that all stack tops for config refer to key
		 * states in LR rule.
		 *
		 * To verify we are in the right situation we must first check
		 * closure is at a StarLoopEntryState generated during LR removal.
		 * Then we check that each stack top of context is a return state
		 * from one of these cases:
		 *
		 *   1. 'not' expr, '(' type ')' expr. The return state points at loop entry state
		 *   2. expr op expr. The return state is the block end of internal block of (...)*
		 *   3. 'between' expr 'and' expr. The return state of 2nd expr reference.
		 *      That state points at block end of internal block of (...)*.
		 *   4. expr '?' expr ':' expr. The return state points at block end,
		 *      which points at loop entry state.
		 *
		 * If any is true for each stack top, then closure does not add a
		 * config to the current config set for edge[0], the loop entry branch.
		 *
		 *  Conditions fail if any context for the current config is:
		 *
		 *   a. empty (we'd fall out of expr to do a global FOLLOW which could
		 *      even be to some weird spot in expr) or,
		 *   b. lies outside of expr or,
		 *   c. lies within expr but at a state not the BlockEndState
		 *   generated during LR removal
		 *
		 * Do we need to evaluate predicates ever in closure for this case?
		 *
		 * No. Predicates, including precedence predicates, are only
		 * evaluated when computing a DFA start state. I.e., only before
		 * the lookahead (but not parser) consumes a token.
		 *
		 * There are no epsilon edges allowed in LR rule alt blocks or in
		 * the "primary" part (ID here). If closure is in
		 * StarLoopEntryState any lookahead operation will have consumed a
		 * token as there are no epsilon-paths that lead to
		 * StarLoopEntryState. We do not have to evaluate predicates
		 * therefore if we are in the generated StarLoopEntryState of a LR
		 * rule. Note that when making a prediction starting at that
		 * decision point, decision d=2, compute-start-state performs
		 * closure starting at edges[0], edges[1] emanating from
		 * StarLoopEntryState. That means it is not performing closure on
		 * StarLoopEntryState during compute-start-state.
		 *
		 * How do we know this always gives same prediction answer?
		 *
		 * Without predicates, loop entry and exit paths are ambiguous
		 * upon remaining input +b (in, say, a+b). Either paths lead to
		 * valid parses. Closure can lead to consuming + immediately or by
		 * falling out of this call to expr back into expr and loop back
		 * again to StarLoopEntryState to match +b. In this special case,
		 * we choose the more efficient path, which is to take the bypass
		 * path.
		 *
		 * The lookahead language has not changed because closure chooses
		 * one path over the other. Both paths lead to consuming the same
		 * remaining input during a lookahead operation. If the next token
		 * is an operator, lookahead will enter the choice block with
		 * operators. If it is not, lookahead will exit expr. Same as if
		 * closure had chosen to enter the choice block immediately.
		 *
		 * Closure is examining one config (some loopentrystate, some alt,
		 * context) which means it is considering exactly one alt. Closure
		 * always copies the same alt to any derived configs.
		 *
		 * How do we know this optimization doesn't mess up precedence in
		 * our parse trees?
		 *
		 * Looking through expr from left edge of stat only has to confirm
		 * that an input, say, a+b+c; begins with any valid interpretation
		 * of an expression. The precedence actually doesn't matter when
		 * making a decision in stat seeing through expr. It is only when
		 * parsing rule expr that we must use the precedence to get the
		 * right interpretation and, hence, parse tree.

		 Sam pointed out a problem with the previous definition, v3, of

		 alternatives, we should keep going. For example, the following grammar

		 s : (ID | ID ID?) ';' ;

		 When the ATN simulation reaches the state before ';', it has a DFA
		 state that looks like: [12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]. Naturally
		 12|1|[] and 12|2|[] conflict, but we cannot stop processing this node
		 because alternative to has another way to continue, via [6|2|[]].
		 The key is that we have a single state that has config's only associated
		 with a single alternative, 2, and crucially the state transitions
		 among the configurations are all non-epsilon transitions. That means
		 we don't consider any conflicts that include alternative 2. So, we
		 ignore the conflict between alts 1 and 2. We ignore a set of
		 conflicting alts when there is an intersection with an alternative
		 associated with a single alt state in the state→config-list map.

		 It's also the case that we might have two conflicting configurations but
		 also a 3rd nonconflicting configuration for a different alternative:
		 [1|1|[], 1|2|[], 8|3|[]]. This can come about from grammar:

		 a : A | A | A B ;

		 After matching input A, we reach the stop state for rule A, state 1.
		 State 8 is the state right before B. Clearly alternatives 1 and 2
		 conflict and no amount of further lookahead will separate the two.
		 However, alternative 3 will be able to continue and so we do not
		 stop working on this state. In the previous example, we're concerned
		 with states associated with the conflicting alternatives. Here alt
		 3 is not associated with the conflicting configs, but since we can continue
		 looking for input reasonably, I don't declare the state done. We
		 ignore a set of conflicting alts when we have an alternative
		 that we still need to pursue.
