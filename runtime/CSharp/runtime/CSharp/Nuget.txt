Publishing to Nuget from Linux/MacOSX
===================================

Getting ready to run Nuget
==========================
Of course you need Mono to be installed. 
You then need to download nuget.exe from here: https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe
From the Terminal, you can check all is ok by typing: mono <path-to-nuget.exe>. This should display the nuget help.

Creating the assembly
=====================
Navigate to the runtime/CSharp/Antlr4.Runtime directory.
Type: mono xbuild /p:Configuration=Release Antlr4.Runtime.mono.csproj
Alternately, you may want to build ANTLR using Xamarin Studio Community (free).

Packaging for NuGet
===================
Navigate to the runtime/CSharp solution root, where the Package.nuspec file resides.
Type the following command: mono <path-to-nuget.exe> pack Package.nuspec.
This shoud display: Successfully created package <package-path>

Publishing to NuGet
===================
You need to be a NuGet owner for "ANTLR 4 Standard Runtime"
As a registered NuGet user, you can then manually upload the package here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/manage/upload
Alternately, you can publish from the cmd line:
- you need to get your NuGet key from https://www.nuget.org/account#
- from the cmd line, you can then type: 
	mono <path-to-nuget.exe> push Antlr.4.Runtime.<version>.nupkg <your-key> -Source https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package
