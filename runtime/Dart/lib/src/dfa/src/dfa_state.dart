/// A DFA state represents a set of possible ATN configurations.
///  As Aho, Sethi, Ullman p. 117 says "The DFA uses its state
///  to keep track of all possible states the ATN can be in after
///  reading each input symbol.  That is to say, after reading
///  input a1a2..an, the DFA is in a state that represents the
///  subset T of the states of the ATN that are reachable from the
///  ATN's start state along some path labeled a1a2..an."
///  In conventional NFA&rarr;DFA conversion, therefore, the subset T
///  would be a bitset representing the set of states the
///  ATN could be in.  We need to track the alt predicted by each
///  state as well, however.  More importantly, we need to maintain
///  a stack of states, tracking the closure operations as they
///  jump from rule to rule, emulating rule invocations (method calls).
///  I have to add a stack to simulate the proper lookahead sequences for
///  the underlying LL grammar from which the ATN was derived.
///
///  <p>I use a set of ATNConfig objects not simple states.  An ATNConfig
///  is both a state (ala normal conversion) and a RuleContext describing
///  the chain of rules (if any) followed to arrive at that state.</p>

///  meaning that state was reached via a different set of rule invocations.</p>
