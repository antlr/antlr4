publishing to npm
=================
The JavaScript runtime is published on npm.
There is nothing to build since JavaScript is based on source code only.
The JavaScript itself is tested using npm, so assumption is npm is already installed.
The current npm version used is 3.10.9.
The publishing itself relies on the information in src/antlr4/package.json.
To publish, from Terminal, you need to navigate to the src/ directory.
Once there, login: npm login
Then npm publish antlr4
That's it!
