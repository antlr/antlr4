for more information on using ANTLR in JavaScript

This runtime requires node version >= 14, the first version to officially support ES semantics.

ANTLR 4 runtime is available in 10 target languages, and favors consistency of versioning across targets.
As such it cannot follow recommended NPM semantic versioning.
If you install a specific version of antlr4, we strongly recommend you remove the corresponding ^ in your package.json.
