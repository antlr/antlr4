<!--
Thank you for proposing a contribution to the ANTLR project!

As of 4.10, ANTLR uses the Linux Foundation's Developer
Certificate of Origin, DCO, version 1.1. See either
https://developercertificate.org/ or the
developer-certificate-of-origin.txt file in the main directory.
You have nothing to sign but be aware that this DCO is operative,
even if you have signed the previous ANTLR contributor's
certificate of origin.
