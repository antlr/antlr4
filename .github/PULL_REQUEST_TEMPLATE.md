<!--
Thank you for proposing a contribution to the ANTLR project!

(Please make sure PRs are working from a branch other than dev or master.)

As of 4.10, ANTLR uses the Linux Foundation's Developer
Certificate of Origin, DCO, version 1.1. See either
https://developercertificate.org/ or file 
contributors-cert-of-origin.txt in the main directory.

Each commit requires a "signature", which is simple as
adding `-s` to the git commit command:

git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'

Github's pull request process enforces the sig and gives
instructions on how to fix if any commits lack the sig.
See https://github.com/apps/dco for more info.
