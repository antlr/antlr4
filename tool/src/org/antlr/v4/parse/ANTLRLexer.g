// Version   : First implemented as part of ANTLR 3.2 this is the self
//             hosting ANTLR 3 Lexer.
//
// Description
// -----------
// This is the definitive lexer grammar for parsing ANTLR V3.x.x grammars. All other
// gramnmars are derived from this grammar via source code control integration (perforce)
// or by the gdiff tool.
//
// This grammar and its associated grmmmars A3Parser.g and A3Walker.g exhibit the following
// traits, which are recommended for all production quality grammars:
//
// 1) They are separate grammars, not composite grammars;
// 2) They implement all supporting methods in a superclass (at least this is recommended
//    for language targets that support inheritence;
// 3) All errors are pushed as far down the parsing chain as possible, which means
//    that the lexer tries to defer error reporting to the parser, and the parser
//    tries to defer error reporting to a semantic phase consisting of a single
//    walk of the AST. The reason for this is that the error messages produced
//    from later phases of the parse will generally have better context and so
//    be more useful to the end user. Consider the message: "Syntax error at 'options'"
//    vs: "You cannot specify two options{} sections in a single grammar file".
// 4) The lexer is 'programmed' to catch common mistakes such as unterminated literals
//    and report them specifically and not just issue confusing lexer mismatch errors.
//

/** Read in an ANTLR grammar and build an AST.  Try not to do
 *  any actions, just build the tree.

 *  The phases are:
 *
 *		A3Lexer.g (this file)
 *              A3Parser.g
 *              A3Verify.g (derived from A3Walker.g)
 *		assign.types.g
 *		define.g
 *		buildnfa.g

// ==============================================================================
// Note that while this grammar does not care about order of constructs
// that don't really matter, such as options before @header etc, it must first
// be parsed by the original v2 parser, before it replaces it. That parser does
// care about order of structures. Hence we are constrained by the v2 parser
// for at least the first bootstrap release that causes this parser to replace
// the v2 version.
// ==============================================================================

// -------
// Options
//
// V3 option directives to tell the tool what we are asking of it for this
// grammar.
//
options {

	// Target language is Java, which is the default but being specific
	// here as this grammar is also meant as a good example grammar for
	// for users.

	language      = Java;

	// The super class that this lexer should expect to inherit from, and
	// which contains any and all support routines for the lexer. This is
	// commented out in this baseline (definitive or normative grammar)
	// - see the ANTLR tool implementation for hints on how to use the super
	//   class
