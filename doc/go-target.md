# ANTLR4 Language Target, Runtime for Go

### First steps

#### 1. Install ANTLR4

[The getting started guide](getting-started.md) should get you started.

#### 2. Get the Go ANTLR runtime

Each target language for ANTLR has a runtime package for running parser generated by ANTLR4. 
The runtime provides a common set of tools for using your parser. Note that if you have existing projects and have 
yet to replace the `v1.x.x` modules with the `v4` modules, then you can skip ahead to the section *Upgrading to v4
from earlier versions*

The Go runtime uses modules and has a version path of `/v4` to stay in sync with the runtime versions of all the other runtimes.
Setup is the same as any other module based project:

```bash
$ cd mymodproject
$ go mod init mymodproject
```

After which, you can use go get, to get the latest release version of the ANTLR v4 runtime using:

```bash
go get github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr/v4
```

If your project is already using the v4 runtime, then you can upgrade to the latest release using the usual:

```bash
go get -u github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr/v4
```
If you have not yet upgraded existing projects to the `/v4` module path, consult the section *Upgrading to v4
from earlier versions*

The ANTLR runtime has only one external dependency, and that is part of the go system itself:

```
golang.org/x/exp
```

A complete list of releases can be found on [the release page](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/releases). The Go 
runtime will be tagged using standard Go tags, so release 4.11.0 will be tagged with `v4.11.0` and go get will pick
that up from the ANTLR repo.

#### 3. Configuring `go generate` in your project

In order to promote the use of repeatable builds, it is often useful to add the latest tool jar to your project's
repo and configure a `generate.sh` and `generate.go` file. You can of course globally alias the java command required to run the
tool. Your own CI and dev environment will guide you.

Here is how you can configure `go generate` for your project, assuming that you follow the general recommendation to
place the ANTLR grammar files in their own package in your project structure. Here is a general template as a starting point:

```
	.
	├── myproject
	├── parser
	│     ├── mygrammar.g4
	│     ├── antlr-4.11.0-complete.jar
	│     ├── error_listeners.go
	│     ├── generate.go
	│     ├── generate.sh
	├── go.mod
	├── go.sum
	├── main.go
	└── main_test.go
```

Make sure that the package statement in your grammar file(s) reflects the go package they exist in.
The `generate.go` file then looks like this:

```golang
	package parser

	//go:generate ./generate.sh
```

And the `generate.sh` file will look similar to this:

```shell

	#!/bin/sh

	alias antlr4='java -Xmx500M -cp "./antlr4-4.11.0-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH" org.antlr.v4.Tool'
	antlr4 -Dlanguage=Go -no-visitor -package parser *.g4
```

From the command line at the root of your package “myproject” you can then simply issue the command:

```shell
	go generate ./...
```

If you have not yet run a `go get`, you can now run `go mod tidy` and update your 

#### 4. Generate your parser manually

You use the ANTLR4 "tool" to generate a parser. These will reference the ANTLR runtime, installed above.

Suppose you're using a UNIX system and have set up an alias for the ANTLR4 tool as described in
[the getting started guide](getting-started.md). 

To generate your go parser, you'll need to invoke:

```bash
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Go MyGrammar.g4
```

### Upgrading to `/v4` from the default path

*NB: While switch to new module path would normally imply that the public interface for the runtime has changed, this is
not actually the case - you will not need to change your existing code to upgrade. The main point of the path change is so
that git tagging works with the ANTLR Go runtime.*

Prior to release v4.11.0 the Go runtime shipped with a module but the module had no version path. This meant that
the tags in the ANTLR repo did not work, as any tag above `v1` must refer to a matching module path. 
So the command `go get github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr` would just bring in
whatever was the `HEAD` of the master branch. While this *kind of* worked, it is obviously subject to problems and does
not fit properly with the idiomatic ways of Go.

As of v4.11.0 the module path for the Go runtime is properly in sync with the repo tags. However, this means you need to
perform a few simple actions in order to upgrade to the `/v4` path. 

 - Firstly, make sure that you are using an ANTLR tool jar with a version number of 4.11.0 or greater.
 - Next you replace any mention of the old (default) path to ANTLR in your go source files. Don't worry that this will
modify your generated files as...
 - Now regenerate your grammar files either manually or using `go generate ./...` (see above)

A quick way to replace original module path references is to use this script from your module's base directory:

```shell
find . -type f \
    -name '*.go' \
    -exec sed -i -e 's,github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr,github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr/v4,g' {} \;
```
After performing the steps above, issuing:

```shell
go mod tidy
```
Should fix up your `go.mod` file to reference only the `v4` version of the ANTLR Go runtime:

```shell
require github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr/v4 v4.11.0-xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx
```

From this point on, your go mod commands will work correctly with the ANTLR repo and upgrades and downgrades will work
as you expect. As will branch version such as @dev

### Referencing the Go ANTLR runtime

You can reference the go ANTLR runtime package like this:

```golang
import "github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr/v4"
```

### Complete example

Suppose you're using the JSON grammar from https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/json placed in the parser
directory and have initialized your `go mod` file.

Then, invoke `antlr4 -Dlanguage=Go JSON.g4`. The result of this is a collection of .go files in the `parser` directory including:
```
json_parser.go
json_base_listener.go
json_lexer.go
json_listener.go
```

Another common option to the ANTLR tool is `-visitor`, which generates a parse tree visitor, but we won't be doing that here. 
For a full list of antlr4 tool options, please visit the [tool documentation page](tool-options.md).

We'll write a small main func to call the generated parser/lexer (assuming they are separate). This one writes out the 
encountered `ParseTreeContext`'s. Assuming the generated parser code is in the `parser` directory relative to this code:

```golang
package main

import (
	"github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr/v4"
	"./parser"
	"os"
	"fmt"
)

type TreeShapeListener struct {
	*parser.BaseJSONListener
}

func NewTreeShapeListener() *TreeShapeListener {
	return new(TreeShapeListener)
}

func (this *TreeShapeListener) EnterEveryRule(ctx antlr.ParserRuleContext) {
	fmt.Println(ctx.GetText())
}

func main() {
	input, _ := antlr.NewFileStream(os.Args[1])
	lexer := parser.NewJSONLexer(input)
	stream := antlr.NewCommonTokenStream(lexer,0)
	p := parser.NewJSONParser(stream)
	p.AddErrorListener(antlr.NewDiagnosticErrorListener(true))
	p.BuildParseTrees = true
	tree := p.Json()
	antlr.ParseTreeWalkerDefault.Walk(NewTreeShapeListener(), tree)
}
```

This one expects the input to be passed on the command line:

```
go run test.go input
```

The output is:

```
{"a":1}
{"a":1}
"a":1
1
```
