ANTLR v4 Honey Badger

January 15, 2013

* Tweak error messages
* (Tool) Make TokenVocabParser fields `protected final`
* Fix generated escape sequences for literals containing backslashes

January 14, 2013

* Relax parser in favor of errors during semantic analysis
* Add error 145: lexer mode must contain at least one non-fragment rule
* Add error 146: non-fragment lexer rule can match the empty string

January 11, 2013

* Updated error 72, 76; added 73-74 and 136-143: detailed errors about name
  conflicts
* Report exact location for parameter/retval/local name conflicts
* Add error 144: multi-character literals are not allowed in lexer sets
* Error 134 now only applies to rule references in lexer sets
* Updated error messages (cleanup)
* Reduce size of _serializedATN by adding 2 to each element: new representation
  avoids embedded values 0 and 0xFFFF which are common and have multi-byte
  representations in Java's modified UTF-8

January 10, 2013

* Add error 135: cannot assign a value to list label: $label
  (fixes antlr/antlr4#128)

January 2, 2013

* Fix EOF handling (antlr/antlr4#110)
* Remove TREE_PARSER reference
* Additional validation checks in ATN deserialization
* Fix potential NPE in parser predicate evaluation
* Fix termination condition detection in full-context parsing

January 1, 2013

* Updated documentation
* Minor code cleanup
* Added the `-XdbgSTWait` command line option for the Tool
* Removed method override since bug was fixed in V3 runtime

December 31, 2012

* I altered Target.getTargetStringLiteralFromANTLRStringLiteral() so that
  it converts \uXXXX in an ANTLR string to \\uXXXX, thus, avoiding Java's
  conversion to a single character before compilation.

December 16, 2012

* Encapsulate some fields in ANTLRMessage
* Remove ErrorType.INVALID
* Update error/warning messages, show all v3 compatibility messages

December 12, 2012

* Use arrays instead of HashSet to save memory in SemanticContext.AND/OR
* Use arrays instead of HashSet to save memory in cached DFA
* Reduce single-operand SemanticContext.and/or operations

December 11, 2012

* Add -long-messages option; only show exceptions with errors when set
* "warning treated as error" is a one-off error
* Listen for issues reported by StringTemplate, report them as warnings
* Fix template issues
* GrammarASTWithOptions.getOptions never returns null
* Use EnumSet instead of HashSet
* Use new STGroup.GROUP_FILE_EXTENSION value

December 2, 2012

* Remove -Xverbose-dfa option
* Create the ParseTreeVisitor interface for all visitors, rename previous base
  visitor class to AbstractParseTreeVisitor

December 1, 2012

* escape [\n\r\t] in lexical error messages; e.g,:
  line 2:3 token recognition error at: '\t'
  line 2:4 token recognition error at: '\n'

* added error for bad sets in lexer; e.g.:
  lexer set element A is invalid (either rule ref or literal with > 1 char)
  some tests in TestSets appeared to allow ~('a'|B) but it was randomly working.
  ('a'|B) works, though doesn't collapse to a set.

* label+='foo' wasn't generating good code. It was generating token type as
  variable name. Now, I gen "s<ttype>" for implicit labels on string literals.

* tokens now have token and char source to draw from.

* remove -Xsave-lexer option; log file as implicit lexer AST.

November 30, 2012

* Maven updates (cleanup, unification, and specify Java 6 bootstrap classpath)

November 28, 2012

* Maven updates (uber-jar, manifest details)

November 27, 2012

* Maven updates (prepare for deploying to Sonatype OSS)
* Use efficient bitset tests instead of long chains of operator ==

November 26, 2012

* Maven updates (include sources and javadocs, fix warnings)
* Don't generate action methods for lexer rules not containing an action
* Generated action and sempred methods are private
* Remove unused / problematic methods:
** (unused) TerminalNodeImpl.isErrorNode
** (unused) RuleContext.conflictsWith, RuleContext.suffix.
** (problematic) RuleContext.hashCode, RuleContext.equals.

November 23, 2012

* Updated Maven build (added master POM, cleaned up module POMs)

November 22, 2012

* make sure left-recur rule translation uses token stream from correct imported file.
* actions like @after in imported rules caused inf loop.
* This misidentified scope lexer/parser: @lexer::members { } @parser::members { }

November 18, 2012

* fixed: undefined rule refs caused exception
* cleanup, rm dead etypes, add check for ids that cause code gen issues
* added notion of one-off error
* added check for v3 backward incompatibilities:
** tree grammars
** labels in lexer rules
** tokens {A;B;} syntax
** tokens {A='C';} syntax
** {...}?=> gate semantic predicates
** (...)=> syntactic predicates
* Detect EOF in lexer rule

November 17, 2012

* .tokens files goes in output dir like parser file.
* added check: action in lexer rules must be last element of outermost alt
* properly check for grammar/filename difference
* if labels, don't allow set collapse for
  a : A # X | B ;
* wasn't checking soon enough for rule redef; now it sets a dead flag in
  AST so no more walking dup.
  error(51): T.g:7:0: rule s redefinition (ignoring); previous at line 3

November 11, 2012

* Change version to 4.0b4 (btw, forgot to push 4.0b3 in build.properties when
  I made git tag 4.0b3...ooops).

November 4, 2012

* Kill box in tree dialog box makes dialog dispose of itself

October 29, 2012

* Sam fixes nongreedy more.
* -Werror added.
* Sam made speed improvement re preds in lexer.

October 20, 2012

* Merged Sam's fix for nongreedy lexer/parser. lots of unit tests. A fix in
  prediction ctx merge. https://github.com/parrt/antlr4/pull/99

October 14, 2012

* Rebuild how ANTLR detects SLL conflict and failover to full LL.  LL is
  a bit slower but correct now.  Added ability to ask for exact ambiguity
  detection.

October 8, 2012

* Fixed a bug where labeling the alternatives of the start rule caused
  a null pointer exception.

October 1, 2012 -- 4.0b2 release

September 30, 2012

* Fixed the unbuffered streams, which actually buffered everything
  up by mistake. tweaked a few comments.

* Added a getter to IntStream for the token factory

* Added -depend cmd-line option.

September 29, 2012

* no nongreedy or wildcard in parser.

September 28, 2012

* empty "tokens {}" is ok now.

September 22, 2012

* Rule exception handlers weren't passed to the generated code
* $ruleattribute.foo weren't handled properly
* Added -package option

September 18, 2012 -- 4.0b1 release
