/**
 * In this case, we have to ensure that the predicates are not tested
 * during the closure after recognizing the 1st ID. The closure will
 * fall off the end of 'a' 1st time and reach into the a[1] rule
 * invocation. It should not execute predicates because it does not know
 * what the parameter is. The context stack will not be empty and so
 * they should be ignored. It will not affect recognition, however. We
 * are really making sure the ATN simulation doesn't crash with context
 * object issues when it encounters preds during FOLLOW.
