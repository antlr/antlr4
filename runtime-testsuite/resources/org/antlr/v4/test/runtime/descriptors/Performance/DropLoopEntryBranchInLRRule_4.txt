for https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/1398.
Seeing through a large expression takes 5 _minutes_ on
my fast box to complete.  After fix, it's instantaneous.
Was working for C++ but I think it was not parsing correctly (Nov 2022)
So I'll make it skip for now and will add bug. I believe it is not
merging arrays properly.
