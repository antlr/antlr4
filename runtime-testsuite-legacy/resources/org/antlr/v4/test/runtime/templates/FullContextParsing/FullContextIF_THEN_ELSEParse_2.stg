// Technically, this input sequence is not ambiguous because else
// uniquely predicts going into the optional subrule. else cannot
// be matched by exiting stat since that would only match '}' or
// the start of a stat. But, we are using the theory that
// SLL(1)=LL(1) and so we are avoiding full context parsing
// by declaring all else clause parsing to be ambiguous.
