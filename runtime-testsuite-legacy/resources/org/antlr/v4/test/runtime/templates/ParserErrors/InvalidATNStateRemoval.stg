/**
 * This is a regression test for #45 "NullPointerException in ATNConfig.hashCode".
 * https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/45
 * <p/>
 * The original cause of this issue was an error in the tool's ATN state optimization,
 * which is now detected early in {@link ATNSerializer} by ensuring that all
 * serialized transitions point to states which were not removed.
